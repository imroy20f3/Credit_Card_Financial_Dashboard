# Credit_Card_Financial_Dashboard
Created an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze credit card transactions, revenue, and customer demographics. It tracks key KPIs (Revenue, Transactions, Interest Earned), visualizes spend patterns by category, card type, and segments customers by income, age, education, and job type to deliver actionable business insights.
